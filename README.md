* Failed kickstarters for plays in the US tend to have higher goals on average and lower average pledges.
* Kickstarters started in Feb-May tend to have a greater success rate than failure rate. The gap between failure and success is greatest in these months, and the gap begins to close for Kickstarters that launched in June.
* I suggest you cut down your budget, focus on courting a few huge donations, and launch in the first part of the year (not January).
